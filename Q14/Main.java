/*
Problem Description:
Create a base class “Automobile”. An Automobile contains data members ‘make’, ‘type’, ‘maxSpeed’, ‘price’, ‘mileage’, ‘registrationNumber’ etc.
with their reader/writer methods. Now create two sub-classes “Track” and “Car”. Track has data members ‘capacity’, ‘hoodType’, ‘noOfWheels’ etc.
Car has data members ‘noOfDoors’, ‘seatingCapacity’ and their reader/writer methods. Create a main() function to demonstrate this.
