/*
Problem Description:

Create two threads and call them EvenThread and OddThread. EvenThread will print number as 2 4 6 8 10... and
OddThread will print number as 1 3 5â€¦. Now synchronize these two thread to get the output as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

/*
The join () method of thread class waits for a thread to die. It is used when you want one thread to wait for completion of another.
This process is like a relay race where the second runner waits until the first runner comes and hand over the flag to him.
